# :hospital: Daktariml
> :bulb: **Collaborative Project**
## üí¨ Description
> This is a full stack project that is build with django and react. On the core of the project is a machine learning model that predicts illness from a respiratory sound recording. So users can visit the web app and view or add predictions made by the model.

> ## Machine Learning Model
  1. Audio Processing
     > Converts the audio files into suitable format (spectograms)
  1. Feature Extraction
     > Librosa library converts audio signals into spectograms or mfcc which represent frequency.
  1. Model Architecture
     > Model is build with CNN where the spectograms are treated as images and can be adapted for audio classification with layers such as Conv2D, Maxpool, dense and flatten.
  1. Model Compilations
     > 100 epochs used in training the model with accuracy of 77%
